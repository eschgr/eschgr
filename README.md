Welcome to my Github repository. This is just a smattering of fun projects that I've likely gotten halfway complete.

I'm a Software Engineer with 15+ years industry experience working on projects which impact your life. This repository was started after I was laid off from my position and I began to feel bored, so I started programming for fun. Right now, there's not much here, but I hope to have that change quickly and make this group of projects grow.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eschgr
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, large scale serve backend and more. I'm interested in all forms of software and making things that you find useful.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning artifical intelligence. I'm looking to understand how to use AI to drive more impact on people's lives in a positive way. I am looking to turn AI into a copilot which can help improve your work capabilities and act as a partner to collaborate in your engineering processes.
